# ImmoWeb Data Analysis and Prediction Models

A multi-week project combining our skills with plotting, analyzing and regression models.

## About the project

This repository includes work done over 2 different projects that will be concluded with a final price predictor project (yet to be added). It consists of Data processing and machine learning with said Data to make target prediction.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Scraper (Part One) 
![CSV](./output/csvfile.png)
Pilot project: [our Data Scraper.](https://github.com/danielbauwens/challenge-collecting-data)
The very first project, which can be found in its own repository. 

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Analysis (Part Two) 
![Data!](./output/output.png)

This was made as the second part of a four part study project, where the aim was to get to know and familiarize ourselves with plotting, data visualizations and making correlatinos between multiple Data entries.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Modelling (Part Three) 
![Score](./output/training.png)
This was made as the third part of the study project. The main goal is to understand how to use our datasets with regression machine learning models to predict accurate target values(whatever that may be) based on the inputted features. All the while making sure not to overfit the model to the data at hand.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Prediction Through FastAPI (Part Four/Conclusion) 
This was made as the fourth and last part of our data project. The goal for this part was to harness the power of FastAPI and our previously made model to be able to output predictions based on the  end-users inputted data points. 

## Installation, Requirements and Usage üõÑ

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.xx-orange) ![Requirements](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-For_You-gr)

*The two notebooks include the initial graphing results from part one, and the pipeline used to get the scores from LinearRegression, XGBoost, DecisionTree and RandomForest models. The SRC folder's 'main.py' displays all of the above regressors' scores when run.*


The API section requires only the **'requirements_api.txt'**, if you want to test the older programs which are still in the old source folder, you can download the normal requirements.txt file to get the additional packages for that.

## Timeline üïô

*For the initial part 1's timeline, see the **related** section.*

**Part Two(*Data Analysis*)** was completed over the course of 5 (work)days, from the 5th of Juli to the 11th of Juli.

**Part Three(*Data Modelling*)** was completed over the course of 4 days, from the 17th of Juli to the 20th of Juli.

**Part Four(*Data Prediction Through the API*)** was completed over 3 days, from the 26th of Juli, to the 28th of Juli.


## Future Improvements/Additions üîú

### Data Analysis Improvements:
- Improve correlation accuracy by using a larger dataset.
- Try for different plots to use (map locations, area charts, ...)
- Better usage of color to highlight specific values

### Data Modelling Improvements:
- Explore different regression models to improve score.
- More (Hyper)Parameter Tuning.
- Larger dataset = Better training.
- Cleaner datasets/more pre-processing.
